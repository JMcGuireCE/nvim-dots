# BEHOLD! my dots :)
This is the repo I use to keep track of and sync my Neovim config between my
systems. It's based on the wonderful [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/), which made
my life way easier when I was just getting off of VS Code. Feel free to use
anythink you'd like from here!

Note: Just like with normal NvChad, you'll need a
[NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) and a true-color terminal.

# Setup Language Servers
So far, these are the language servers that have been configured. You'll still
need to install them with 'Mason' before use.

- lua_ls (Lua)
- clangd (C++)
- pylsp (Python)

# Development Environment Recommendations
Here are a few tips that have helped me streamline my workflow a bit.

1. [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is a great terminal-based
UI for git which has vim-like menu navigation. It makes managing git way easier
and gives you all the information you need about your repo at a glance.
1. REMAP CAPS LOCK TO ESCAPE. You'll never go back.
1. Try setting a terminal background. It's a good way to make it feel more like
home.
1. I personally use the dvorak keyboard layout. It's certainly not for everyone,
but it has made typing way more comfortable and enjoyable.
